## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

**To do this challenge, you need a basic understanding of HTML and CSS.**

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this product preview card component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements


## Where to find everything

Your task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design. 

The designs are in JPG static format. Using JPGs will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`. 

You will find all the required assets in the `/images` folder. The assets are already optimized.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file containing the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.

## About the Solution

The project is to built a product preview card.

A card in which we have product and its specifications on a card format.

On the left side of the card we have the image of the product.

On the right side of the card we have the specifications of the product like description, brand, price, etc.

If we opened the website on the desktop.

On the top of the card we have the image of the product.

On the bottom of the card we have the specifications of the product like description, brand, price, etc.

If we opened the website on the mobile.

Here, we use HTML and CSS because we are creating a static web page.

As the solution needs the structure we have used HTML and CSS for the styling of the webpage.

Coming to the styling we used the FLEX-BOX to fulfilling the requirements.
